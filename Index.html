                      <p class="ProjectSummary">Our class was assigned a client we needed to re-brand. Nathalie is a Dutch Painter that sells commission art.  We divided ourselves in groups and created several different brand-guides, style-scapes and possible website layout designs to make our clients brand, Nathalie Silverentand, more modern and unique. Additionally, we also created a content strategy, focusing in platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Etsy as we had previously researched through interviews and surveys Nathalie s target audience and we wanted to cater her content to fit this specific public. After having several designs ready we would send them to our client so she could give us feedback on what she would like us to keep and what she did not enjoy. For our final design we decided to make use of elements Nathalie liked but that are also out of her brand “style” to offer a different insight to what she is used to.</p>

                  <div class="ReflectionText1">
                    <p>As we worked in groups, we started by ensuring that we understood the basics of technology, media, and design. This meant keeping up with the latest trends and tools available to us. We did this by checking daily sites like Awwwards, Dribble, and Squarespace to see other people's work and get some inspiration.</p><br>
                    <p>Working in groups was key to our success. It allowed us to combine our different skills and perspectives effectively. Each member of the team made an initial brand guide/stylescape to what they thought would best fit our client, Nathalie Silverentand. Getting feedback was crucial throughout the process. We regularly tested our ideas with both users and our client, this helped us make sure that our designs were aligned with Nathalie's vision for her brand.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="ReflectionText2">
                    <p>Our content strategy was informed by what we learned about Nathalie's target audience. By understanding their preferences and behaviors, we were able to tailor our approach to platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Etsy. This ensured that our content would resonate with the people Nathalie wanted to reach.</p><br>
                    <p>In the end, this project taught us a lot about creating digital products that are both user-friendly and in line with the client's goals. As well as considering delivering a product that may not be what the client expected as looking at other peoples perspectives can offer insight to the brands future approach.</p>
